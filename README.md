Information on the different notebooks and folders is in Instructions_for_Juliette_s_Notebooks.pdf.

Thank you to Thomas Gregor's lab for the data.

# Packages needed
Tensorflow, plotly (only useful to plot neural network, not really necessary) (I think need to install tensor flow 1.7.1 to make plotly work), scipy, numpy, matplotlib
